# 486 Face Landmarks - 3D Face Detection

In this project we will see how to detect 468 different landmarks on faces. Facial landmarks are used 
to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:

- Eyes
- Eyebrows
- Nose
- Mouth
- Jawline

Facial landmarks have been successfully applied to face alignment, head pose estimation, face swapping, 
blink detection and much more.
